title: "The Intention Progression Competition"
---

So, not a huge amount to say about [this](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-66534-0_10), my first publication as a co-author emerged from my 2nd year internship with the [Agents Lab at UoN](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/computerscience/research/agents-lab.aspx) where I worked on designing and developing the competitive framework of the [IPC](https://www.intentionprogression.org/). 
Working with the Agents Lab was great fun and I feel like I made good contributions to the project, bringing in my experience with tournament design from my time with EVE and getting to solve some interesting problems and adapt some interesting code. 
Most of my contribution to the project came from interface design and Java based programming but I have sadly not seen the outcome with the global pandemic pushing back the attempts to run the competition so I hope to update this entry when that develops more.
